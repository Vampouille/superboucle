Description: Loop application synced with jack transport
 SuperBoucle is a loop based software fully controllable with any midi device.
 SuperBoucle is also synced with jack transport. You can use it on live
 performance or for composition.
 SuperBoucle is composed of a matrix of sample controllable with external midi
 device like pad. SuperBoucle will send back information to midi device (light
 up led). Sample will always start and stop on a beat or group of beats. You can
 adjust duration of sample (loop period) in beat and offset in beat. But you can
 also adjust sample offset in raw frame count negative or positive. Which mean
 sample can start before next beat (useful for reversed sample). You can record
 loop of any size, adjust BPM, reverse, normalize samples, ...
